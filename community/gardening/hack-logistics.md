## Hackathon Logistics
Here's how we'll hack together. Following these guidelines will keep you eligible for prizes and charitable donations, and will set us up for for maxiumum community impact.

1.

Need to fork an existing Spinnaker project(s) to hack? Fork into the [Spinnaker-Hacakthon](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon):
{%
  include
  figure
  image_path="./Org-fork.png"
%}
When it's time to submit a pull request, do so from your fork. Read more on [best practices in fork & pull request workflows](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

Starting fresh with some new plugin code, or writing a tutorial? Create a project repository in [Spinnaker-Hacakthon](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon). Name your repo with a descriptive project string that you'll use in your Slack channel name. _Note: Your Github handle will be added as a member to the Spinnaker-Hackathon organization after check in. You must check in to receive repository creation privileges. Get the check-in link by joining the [Gardening Central](<zoom link>) Zoom room._


_Even if you're starting solo_, create a team channel for your project in [Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io). Use format: #gardening-team-<projectString>
