## What to hack

Not sure where to get started? Suggestions:

* Join the [Project Matchmaking session(<zoom link>) at 8:40 AM PST on Thursday 4/9, right after kickoff. Teams and individuals can take 90 seconds to pitch an idea and invite attendees to a Slack channel to organize.
* Visit the [list of beginner-friendly Spinnaker issues](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22+). Each issue has a Slack channel referencing the issue number (e.g. #gardening-team-issue-5357). Check the channel to collaborate.
* Help make Spinnaker documentation easier to use. Participate in a spinnaker.io card sorting exercise asynchronously. Start [here](https://www.provenbyusers.com/cs.php?c=26cc8242). Stop by the #sig-documentation Slack channel if you have questions or want to chat!
* Create a custom separate stage plugin. This will leverage the new  SimpleStage extension point to add your custom pipeline stage to Spinnaker. Read more in the [Plugin Creators Guide](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/developer/plugin-creators/)
* Review the [Project Ideas Wiki](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening/wiki/Project-Ideas)for inspiration, then hop over Slack to discuss.
* Add quality answers to [questions tagged "Spinnaker" on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spinnaker). To have your answers counted as contributions, share question links in the #gardening-stackoverflow channel and indicate your username.
