## Hackathon Activities

1.
2. Create a repository for your project. Name your repository with a descriptive project string that you'll use in your Slack channel name. Your Github handle will be added to the Spinnaker-Hackathon organization after you check in. So, you'll need to check in to receive repository creation privileges. Get the check-in link by joining the [Gardening Central](<zoom link>) Zoom room.
3. Create a team channel for your project in [Spinnaker Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io). Use format: #gardening-team-<projectString>
