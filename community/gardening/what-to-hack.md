## Hackathon Activities


Not sure where to get started? Suggestions:

* Visit the [list of beginner-friendly Spinnaker issues](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22+). Each issue has a Slack channel referencing the issue number (e.g. #gardening-team-issue-5357). Check the channel to collaborate.
* Help make Spinnaker documentation easier to use. Participate in a spinnaker.io card sorting exercise asynchronously. Start [here](https://www.provenbyusers.com/cs.php?c=26cc8242). Stop by the #sig-documentation Slack channel if you have questions or want to chat!
