## About

Gardening Days rewards new and veteran contributors for building the Spinnaker ecosystem. All contributions attendees make in the week add up to points. This includes project and plugin code, documentation, content, videos, issues [and more](https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/what-to-hack/). All registered contributors will receive prizes based on their point totals, so contribute when you can. After you [sign up](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/spinnaker-summit/register/), you'll be matched with a team. Teams can choose a project and compete in [a challenge category](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening/blob/master/challenges.md) for team prize packages. Summit Gardening challenges teams to build software delivery solutions and content focused on Spinnaker, GitHub Action, Sumo Logic, AWS, New Relic, and more.
