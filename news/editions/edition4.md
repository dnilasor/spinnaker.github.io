## [How to Build a Spinnaker Plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7BmMY1kR10)
This how-to video series demonstrates the process of building a plugin to extend Spinnaker with custom functionality. Learn to leverage an extension point to [add a custom stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7BmMY1kR10) to Spinnaker, to do [the build process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AIOXdgvNqs) for your custom stage plugin, to [develop a plugin frontend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9NVlG58NYo), and to [deliver your plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2eyc9gzNS0) to your Spinnaker environment.

## [Using CodeBuild in Spinnaker for continuous integration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/using-codebuild-in-spinnaker-for-continuous-integration/)
Learn how to use AWS CodeBuild in Spinnaker to provide fully managed continuous integration capabilities as a stage in a Spinnaker pipeline. Follow this guide to enable and connect to the AWS provider, then access and configure pipeline triggers for your CodeBuild projects.

## [Integrating Spinnaker with ServiceNow](https://www.armory.io/blog/integrating-spinnaker-with-servicenow/)
Using ServiceNow as a system of record for software code and infrastructure changes to production  environments? In this video and blog, learn to trigger Spinnaker pipelines from ServiceNow, use Spinnaker Pipeline Expressions to capture build metadata, and automate ServiceNow change requests.

## [Join us June 18th for Spinnaker.Live](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/spinnaker-live/)
Spinnaker.Live, a four-hour live stream event, will focus on building the global community and sharing new achievements, best practices, and success stories. Hear keynotes and panels from SDLC innovators like Kelsey Hightower, catch Spinnaker buzz from key contributors in talks like "Introducing a Kubernetes-native Spinnaker installation path using Kustomize and Kleat," and invite your boss to hear enterprise use cases from Adobe, Autodesk, Nike, Redbox, SAP, and Snap. [Register now](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/spinnaker-live/register/)!

## [Developing for Spinnaker with Minnaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSZlWf9rUI4)
Use Minnaker (https://github.com/armory/minnaker) to quickly set up Spinnaker in a VM for development. Host this VM in the cloud or locally with 16 GB of RAM at minimum. Steps: Install Minnaker, set up remote SSH, and connect to the instance; Test and debug Orca by connecting a local clone to Redis and Front50 in Minnaker with kubectl; Set and test a break point.

## [Learn how to integrate Jenkins with Spinnaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6NaYmD3cJk)
Follow the OpsMx Spinnaker tutorial and begin learning how to integrate Jenkins with Spinnaker to do continuous integration within your software delivery pipelines.

## [How to integrate AWS with Spinnaker - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG9TOrl4tos)
Learn about accounts in the AWS provider for deploying to AWS with Spinnaker. Create the roles, policies, and users needed to set up [managing and managed](https://www.spinnaker.io/setup/install/providers/aws/) accounts.

## [Continuous deployment to Kubernetes using GitHub-triggered Spinnaker pipelines](https://blog.opsmx.com/continuous-deployment-to-kubernetes-using-github-triggered-spinnaker-pipelines/)
Learn to configure a webhook to trigger pipelines in Spinnaker 1.19.1 based on commits to a GitHub repository. Set up Spinnaker to listen to changes in a GitHub artifact repository, inject changed GitHub files as artifacts into your pipeline, and provide execution verification.

## [Spinnaker – Configuring dynamic Kubernetes accounts using Vault](https://blog.opsmx.com/spinnaker-configuring-dynamic-kubernetes-accounts-using-vault/)
We can configure Spinnaker's Clouddriver with external configuration stores, such as HashiCorp Vault, a secrets management tool, to keep Kubernetes account information secure outside of Spinnaker. Consult this guide and its [sequel](https://blog.opsmx.com/spinnaker-externalising-kubeconfig-files-of-kubernetes-accounts/) to learn about externalizing dynamic Kubernetes accounts and kubeconfig files in Vault.

## [Spinnaker Operator Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VojwvcxZF3k)
Take a look at the Spinnaker Operator, a Kubernetes operator for Spinnaker that makes it easier to install, deploy, and upgrade any version of Spinnaker using standard Kubernetes application workflows and tools like kubectl, helm, or kustomize.

## [Spinnaker idea: reusable run job stages via script runner containers](https://medium.com/@tomas_lin/spinnaker-idea-reusable-run-job-stages-via-script-runner-containers-ff5fd95ec056)
Combine the deployment ease of the run script stage with the security advantages of a containerized stage by building general runner containers that run mix-and-match script workflows from S3. Enjoy the flexibility and security of a container runtime, and reduce time spent building containers.

## [A Guide On The Installation Of Spinnaker in Kubernetes Clusters](https://www.magalix.com/blog/a-guide-on-the-installation-of-spinnaker-in-your-production-kubernetes-cluster)
With this guide, use Halyard to install Spinnaker in a Kubernetes cluster, such as one you create in Google Kubernetes Engine. Configure an IAM role, storage bucket, and Halyard, and deploy a production-grade instance of Spinnaker.

## [Spinnaker projects participating in Google Summer of Code](https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/05/18/9-cd-foundation-projects-are-participating-in-this-years-google-summer-of-code/)
This year, we joined GSoC to bring more student developers into the Spinnaker community. We're nurturing two Spinnaker projects: "Drone CI type for Spinnaker pipeline stage" from Victor Odusanya (mentored by Armory engineer [Cameron Motevasselani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtkXeC8a38Y)) and “Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployments with Spinnaker” from Moki Daniel (mentored by Armory engineer [Fernando Freire](https://www.armory.io/blog/identifying-risk-when-executing-your-kubernetes-migration/)).

## [The Continuous Delivery Foundation, interoperability, and open standards](https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/continuous-delivery-foundation/)
Tracy Miranda, the new Governing Board chair of the CDF, discusses the foundation's purpose and interoperability goals on the InfoQ podcast. Read more about Tracy's vision of standardized metadata in continuous delivery pipelines and how Spinnaker's advanced deployment strategies fit in.
